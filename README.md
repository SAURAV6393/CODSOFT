## TASK 1: Number Guessing Game 🎮

This repository contains a simple yet engaging Number Guessing Game where the user guesses a randomly generated number. The game will guide you through the process with helpful feedback after each guess.

### How It Works: ⚙️
1. 🔢 A random number is generated by the program.
2. 🧩 The user has to guess the number within a specified range.
3. 💡 The user has exactly 10 attempts to guess the number.
4. 💬 After each guess, the program will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
5. 🎉 Keep guessing until you find the correct number or run out of attempts!

### Game Features: ✨
- 🎲 Random number generation for unlimited playability.
- 📈 Real-time feedback (high or low) to guide your guesses.
- ⏳ Exactly 10 attempts to guess the number.
- 👶 A fun, interactive experience suitable for all ages.

### Learning Objectives: 🎓
By working with this project, you will:
- 🧠 Practice using random number generation in your code.
- 🔄 Learn how to implement loops and conditional statements.
- ⌨️ Enhance your skills in handling user input.

### Built With: 🛠️
- Programming Language: C++ (or any language you're using).
- Simple logic, fun gameplay.
