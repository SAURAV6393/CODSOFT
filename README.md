# CODSOFT-NumberGuessingGame 🎮

## TASK 1: Number Guessing Game 🎯

This repository contains a simple yet engaging Number Guessing Game where the user guesses a randomly generated number. The game will guide you through the process with helpful feedback after each guess.

### How It Works: ⚙️
1. 🔢 A random number is generated by the program.
2. 🧩 The user has to guess the number within a specified range.
3. 💡 The user has exactly 10 attempts to guess the number.
4. 💬 After each guess, the program will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low.
5. 🎉 Keep guessing until you find the correct number or run out of attempts!

### Game Features: ✨
- 🎲 Random number generation for unlimited playability.
- 📈 Real-time feedback (high or low) to guide your guesses.
- ⏳ Exactly 10 attempts to guess the number.
- 👶 A fun, interactive experience suitable for all ages.

### Learning Objectives: 🎓
By working with this project, you will:
- 🧠 Practice using random number generation in your code.
- 🔄 Learn how to implement loops and conditional statements.
- ⌨️ Enhance your skills in handling user input.

### Built With: 🛠️
- Programming Language: C++ (or any language you're using).
- Simple logic, fun gameplay.

## TASK 2: Advanced Calculator 🧮

### How It Works: ⚙️
1. 🔢 The user inputs two numbers.
2. ➕ The user selects an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, power, or square root).
3. 💻 The program performs the chosen operation on the provided numbers.
4. 📉 The result is displayed to the user.
5. 🔄 Users can choose to perform another calculation or exit.

### Game Features: ✨
- 🔀 Support for multiple operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Power, and Square Root.
- 🚫 Error handling for invalid operations and division by zero.
- 🔁 Looping structure to allow multiple calculations.

### Learning Objectives: 🎓
By developing this advanced calculator, you will:
- 🚀 Understand how to handle user inputs in your code.
- 🔧 Get hands-on experience with a variety of arithmetic operations.
- 🔄 Learn how to implement loops and conditional statements for repeated processes.
- 🔀 Practice handling error cases like division by zero or invalid operations.

### Built With: 🛠️
- Programming Language: C++
- Advanced math functions from the `<cmath>` library.

### Run the Calculator: 🚀
